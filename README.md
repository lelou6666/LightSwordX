LightSwordX is a SOCKS5 proxy client for OS X 10.10+.

It's an open-source project. To get it, you may download the source code and compile it on your Mac, or buy it from Mac App Store.

Price: $0.99

**Why it's not Free on Mac App Store?**

LightSwordX is an open-source software, everyone can download the source code and compile it on Mac without any cost. But you may know **maintenance is the most expensive part** of software. No one can live without money! So, as a developer, I hope people would use and buy it. Thanks.
